In order to make the app work, it is enough to run npm install in the root directory, it will create all the node_modules necessary to run the whole system.

In our application, we implemented two additional functions:
- the map view, which can be seen in the reading list section, showing all the saved wikipedia articles
- the language choice, which can be defined in the settings section, which allows the user to select a language

We are sorry for the late sending
